# Python Exercises – Course Work

This repository contains small Python programs (about 20–30 lines each) that I wrote as part of my university coursework.  

The goal is not to provide optimized or production-ready code, but to document my learning process in Python and basic programming concepts, such as:

- selection (if/elif/else)  
- iteration (for/while loops)  
- string handling  
- functions and modular code  

All programs are console-based and reflect the actual solutions I created during the course. They are kept in their original form to show my progress step by step.  

## Note
These exercises are **for learning purposes only** and should be seen as personal practice from my studies, not as reusable libraries or tools.
